<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-h.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">How can we have great art in our day? We
have no faith. Belief of some sort is the life-blood
of art. When Athene and Zeus ceased to excite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
veneration in the minds of men, sculpture and
architecture both lost their greatness. When the
Madonna and her Son lost that mystery and divinity,
which for the simple minds of the early painters they
possessed, the soul went out of canvas and of wood.
When we carve a Venus now, she is but a frivolous
woman; when we paint a Jesus now, it is but a little
suckling, or a sorrowful prisoner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>a woman, even in</i></div>

<p>We want a great inspiration. We ought to find it
in the things that are really beautiful, but we are not
sure enough, perhaps, what is so. What does dominate
us is a passion for nature: for the sea, for the
sky, for the mountain, for the forest, for the evening
storm, for the break of day. Perhaps when we are
thoroughly steeped in this, we shall reach greatness
once more. But the artificiality of all modern life is
against it, so is its cynicism. Sadness and sarcasm
make a great Lucretius and as a great Juvenal; and
scorn makes a strong Aristophanes: but they do not
make a Praxiteles and an Apelles; they do not even
make a Raffaelle or a Flaxman.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Boston,</i></div>

<p>Art, if it be anything, is the perpetual uplifting of
what is beautiful in the sight of the multitude—the
perpetual adoration of that loveliness, material and
moral, which men in the haste and greed of their
lives are everlastingly forgetting: unless it be that,
it is empty and useless as a child’s reed-pipe when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the reed is snapt and the child’s breath spent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>who can</i></div>

<p>It must have been such a good life—a painter’s in
those days: those early days of art. Fancy the gladness
of it then—modern painters can know nothing
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>produce literature</i></div>

<p>When all the delicate delights of distance were
only half perceived; when the treatment of light and
shadow was barely dreamed of; when aerial perspective
was just breaking on the mind in all its wonder
and power; when it was still regarded as a marvellous
boldness to draw from the natural form in a natural
fashion—in those early days only fancy the delights
of a painter!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>equal</i></div>

<p>Something fresh to be won at each step; something
new to be penetrated at each moment; something
beautiful and rash to be ventured on with each
touch of colour—the painter in those days had all the
breathless pleasure of an explorer; without leaving
his birthplace he knew the joys of Columbus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>to this?</i></div>

<p>And one can fancy nothing better than a life such
as Spinello led for nigh a century up on the hill here,
painting because he loved it, till death took him. Of
all lives, perhaps, that this world has ever seen, the
lives of painters, I say, in those days were the most
perfect.</p>

<p>In quiet places such as Arezzo and Volterra, and
Modena and Urbino, and Cortona and Perugia, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
would grow up a gentle lad who from infancy most
loved to stand and gaze at the missal paintings in his
mother’s house, and the coena in the monk’s refectory,
and when he had fulfilled some twelve or fifteen
years, his people would give in to his wish and send
him to some bottega to learn the management of
colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>No, not even</i></div>

<p>Then he would grow to be a man; and his town
would be proud of him, and find him the choicest of
all work in its churches and its convents, so that all
his days were filled without his ever wandering out
of reach of his native vesper bells.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>in Boston!</i></div>

<p>He would make his dwelling in the heart of his
birthplace, close under its cathedral, with the tender
sadness of the olive hills stretching above and around
in the basiliche or the monasteries his labor would
daily lie; he would have a docile band of hopeful
boyish pupils with innocent eyes of wonder for all he
did or said; he would paint his wife’s face for the
Madonna’s, and his little son’s for the child Angel’s;
he would go out into the fields and gather the olive
bow, and the feathery corn, and the golden fruits,
and paint them tenderly on ground of gold or blue,
in symbol of those heavenly things of which the bells
were forever telling all those who chose to hear; he
would sit in the lustrous nights in the shade of his
own vines and pity those who were not as he was;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
now and then horsemen would come spurring in
across the hills and bring news with them of battles
fought, of cities lost and won; and he would listen
with the rest in the market-place, and go home
through the moonlight thinking that it was well to
create the holy things before which the fiercest rider
and the rudest free-lance would drop the point of the
sword and make the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>It must have been a good life—good to its close in
the cathedral crypt—and so common too; there were
scores of such lived out in these little towns of Italy,
half monastery and half fortress, that were scattered
over hill and plain, by sea and river, on marsh and
mountain, from the daydawn of Cimabue to the after-glow
of the Carracci.</p>

<p>And their work lives after them; the little towns
are all grey and still and half peopled now; the iris
grows on the ramparts, the canes wave in the moats,
the shadows sleep in the silent market-place, the
great convents shelter half a dozen monks, the dim
majestic churches are damp and desolate, and have
the scent of the sepulchre.</p>

<p>But there, above the altars, the wife lives in the
Madonna and the child smiles in the Angel, and the
olive and the wheat are fadeless on their ground of
gold and blue; and by the tomb in the crypt the
sacristan will shade his lantern and murmur with a
sacred tenderness:</p>

<p>“Here he sleeps.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">By a turn of chance a father and son were
thrown together in one of the Western frontier
posts, the father as colonel in command, the
son as a second lieutenant in one of the four companies
quartered there. When the order came
which had brought them together after the three
years which had gone by since the boy left West
Point, it brought great, but silent, happiness to the
stern and gloomy old soldier, and a light-hearted
pleasure to the young man; once more he would be
with “dear old dad,” and besides, life must be rather
exciting out there, and altogether worth a man’s
while. And so he packed his traps in double-quick
time, as a soldier must, and was off in twenty-four
hours. The meeting between the two was a strange
one. Effusive and very gay on the part of the
young man, who made no effort to conceal his
delight; stiff, even cold, on the part of the old man,
whose very heart quivered with joy; and on whose
stern and bronzed face a light came which the boy
did not even see.</p>

<p>The colonel was not a popular man, hard and
cold, rigid in the performance of his own duty, and
with little sympathy for failure on the part of his
men, he was respected, and, in a certain sense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
admired, but not loved; sternly just according to
his own light, but narrow and intolerant. With two
passions—the exaggerated, hide-bound honor of a
soldier who believes his profession to be the only
one; the honor of a strictly honest and very proud
man, jealous of the slightest stain upon his unimpeachable
integrity. The other passion a carefully
hidden but almost idolatrous love for his son. There
had been one other passion, but she died.</p>

<p>Within a month after his coming, the young lieutenant
was the most popular man at the post. He
sang, he danced, he rode, and he played cards; he
also drank rather more than was necessary.</p>

<p>Within two months it all palled upon him. Deadly
ennui took possession of him. The great sunlit
barren plains stretched out interminable. There
were no Indians even to break the monotony. The
iron routine of one day followed upon another with
what seemed to him a stupid, trivial and meaningless
regularity. So he stopped singing and dancing, and
went on playing cards and drinking. Another thing
that annoyed him was his father’s suppressed but
uncompromising disapproval. Inward the colonel’s
soul writhed that his boy should blemish his record
as a soldier in this way; he did not doubt his courage
should the time come for proving it, but in the meantime
to show himself a weak and foolish man was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
almost unbearable. He could not understand the boy,
and he said nothing, which was perhaps unfortunate.</p>

<p>Three weeks went by and the young lieutenant
was deep in debt to the captain of another company.
A sneering, black faced fellow, who had risen from
the ranks; gaining his promotions during the last
fifteen years for acts of dare-devil bravery. He was
not a pleasant man to owe to; particularly if one
was not too sure of being able to pay up when the
notes fell due. Another month, and things were no
better. It was in the early part of September, and
the flat plains stretched out parched and arid, the
sun beat down pitilessly on the treeless little post,
and the money to the captain had to be paid to-morrow.
It was certainly a disagreeable situation.
But they played hard and drank hard, and the young
lieutenant almost forgot that to-morrow was coming.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Is cheating at cards so rare as this?</i></div>

<p>But about one o’clock in the morning there was a
row, and before many hours the whole post knew
what was the matter. It does not take long for news
to travel among a few hundred people, particularly
so interesting and exciting a bit as this. For this gay
young fellow, this dashing young soldier, this son of
the stern old martinet of a colonel, had been caught
cheating at cards, and was disgraced forever.</p>

<p>The news got round and finally reached the
colonel. It was a brave man who told him. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
waited an hour, and then putting a pistol in his
holster, he went across to his son’s quarters. There
was no answer to his knock, so he opened the door
and went in. The boy was sitting by the table,
with his head buried in his arms. He did not look
up when his father spoke, “My son, there is but one
thing for you to do. You know what it is,” and he
laid the pistol on the table. There was no reply;
and the colonel stood silent, straight and stern, but
his face was gray, and his iron mouth was drawn.
Presently the boy raised his head and looked straight
into his father’s eyes. For the first time in his life he
understood. “Yes, father,” he said. The colonel
stood a moment, and then went out and shut the
door. When he was half way across the parade
ground he heard a pistol shot, but he did not go back.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the year 1848 Ralph Waldo Emerson of Concord,
Mass., made a lecturing tour through England.
Among the towns he visited was Coventry,
where he was entertained at the residence of Mr.
Charles Bray. In the family of Mr. Bray lived a
young woman by the name of Mary Ann Evans, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
although this Miss Evans was not handsome, either
in face or figure, she made a decided impression on
Mr. Emerson.</p>

<p>A little excursion was arranged to Stratford, an antiquated
town of some note in the same county. On
this trip Mr. Emerson and Miss Evans paired off very
naturally, and Miss Evans of Coventry was so bold as
to set Mr. Emerson of Concord straight on several
matters relating to Mr. Shakespeare, formerly of
Stratford.</p>

<p>“What is your favorite book?” said Mr. Emerson
to Miss Evans, somewhat abruptly.</p>

<p>“Rousseau’s <i>Confessions</i>,” said the young woman
instantly.</p>

<p>“And so it is mine,” answered Mr. Emerson.</p>

<p>All of which is related by Moncure D. Conway in
a volume entitled <i>Emerson at Home and Abroad</i>.</p>

<p>A copy of Conway’s book was sent to Walt Whitman,
and when he read the passage to which I have
just referred he remarked, “And so it is mine.”</p>

<p>Emerson and Whitman are probably the two strongest
names in American letters, and George Eliot
stands first among women writers of all time; and as
they in common with many Lesser Wits stand side by
side and salute Jean Jacques Rousseau, it may be
worth our while to take just a glance at M. Rousseau’s
book in order, if we can, to know why it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
appeals to people of worth.</p>

<p>The first thing about the volume that attracts is the
title. There is something charmingly alluring and
sweetly seductive in a confession. Mr. Henry James
has said: “The sweetest experience that can come
to a man on his pilgrimage through this vale of tears
is to have a lovely woman ‘confess’ to him; and it
is said that while neither argument, threat, plea of
justification, nor gold can fully placate a woman who
believes she has been wronged by a man, yet she
speedily produces, not only a branch, but a whole
olive tree when he comes humbly home and confesses.”</p>

<p>Now here is a man about to ’fess to the world, and
we take up the volume, glance around to see if any
one is looking, and begin at the first paragraph to
read:</p>

<p>“I purpose an undertaking that never had an example
and the execution of which will never have an
imitation. I would exhibit myself to all men as I am—a
man....</p>

<p>“Let the last trumpet sound when it will, I will
come, with this book in my hand, and present myself
before the Sovereign Judge. I will boldly proclaim:
Thus have I acted, thus have I thought, such
was I. With equal frankness have I disclosed the
good and the evil. I have omitted nothing bad,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
added nothing good. I have exhibited myself, despisable
and vile when so; virtuous, generous, sublime
when so. I have unveiled my interior being as
Thou, Eternal One, hast seen it.” Now where is
the man or woman who could stop there, even though
the cows were in the corn?</p>

<p>And as we read further we find things that are
“unfit for publication” and confessions of sensations
that are so universal to healthy men that they are irrelevant,
and straightway we arise and lock the door
so as to finish the chapter undisturbed. For as superfluous
things are the things we cannot do without,
so is the irrelevant in literature the necessary.</p>

<p>Having finished this chapter, oblivious to calls
that dinner is waiting, we begin the next; and finding
items so interesting that they are disgusting, and
others so indecent that they are entertaining, we forget
the dinner that is getting cold and read on.</p>

<p>And the reason we read on is not because we love
the indecent, or because we crave the disgusting, although
I believe Burke hints at the contrary, but simply
because the writing down of these unbecoming
things convinces us that the man is honest and that
the confession is genuine. In short we come to the
conclusion that any man who deliberately puts himself
in such a bad light—caring not a fig either for
our approbation or our censure—is no sham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>And there you have it! <i>We want honesty in literature.</i></p>

<p>The great orator always shows a dash of contempt
for the opinions of his audience, and the great writer
is he who loses self consciousness and writes himself
down as he is, for at the last analysis all literature is
a confession.</p>

<p>The Ishmaelites who purvey culture by the ton, and
issue magazines that burden the mails—study very carefully
the public palate. They know full well that a
“confession” is salacious: it is an exposure. A
confession implies something that is peculiar, private
and distinctly different from what we are used to. It
is a removing the veil, a making plain things that are
thought and performed in secret.</p>

<p>And so we see articles on “The Women Who
Have Influenced Me,” “The Books that Have
Made Me,” “My Literary Passions,” etc. But like
the circus bills, these titles call for animals that the
big tent never shows; and this perhaps is well, for
otherwise ’twould fright the ladies.</p>

<p>Yes, I frankly admit that these “confessions” suit
the constituency of <i>The Ladies’ Home Journal</i> better
than the truth; and although its editor be a Jew, the
fact that the writers of his confessions practice careful
concealment of the truth that they have hands,
senses, eyes, ears, organs, dimensions, passions, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
wise commercial stroke. You can prick them and
they do not bleed, tickle them and they do not laugh,
poison them and they do not die; simply because
they are only puppets parading as certain virtues,
and these virtues the own particular brand in which
the subscribers delight.</p>

<p>That excellent publication, <i>The Forum</i>, increased
its circulation by many thousand when it ran a series
of confessions of great men wherein these great men
made sham pretense of laying their lives bare before
the public gaze. Nothing was told that did not redound
to the credit of the confessor. The “Formative
Influences” of sin, error and blunders were
carefully concealed or calmly waived. The lack of
good faith was as apparent in these articles as the
rouge on the cheek of a courtesan: the color is genuine
and the woman not dead, that’s all.</p>

<p>And the loss lies in this: These writers—mostly
able men—sell their souls for a price, and produce a
literature that lives the length of life of a moth,
whereas they might write for immortality. Instead
of inspiring the great, they act as clowns to entertain
the rabble.</p>

<p>Of course I know that Rousseau’s <i>Confessions</i>,
Amiel’s <i>Journal</i> and Marie Bashkirtseff’s <i>Diary</i> have
all been declared carefully worked out artifices. And
admitting all the wonderful things that scheming man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
can perform, I still maintain that there are a few
things that life and nature will continue to work out
in the old, old way. I appeal to those who have
tried both plans, whether it is not easier to tell the
truth than to concoct a lie. And I assiduously maintain
that if the case is to be tried by a jury of great
men, that the shocking facts will serve the end far
better than sugared half-truth.</p>

<p>When Richard Le Gallienne tells us of the birth of
his baby and for weeks before how White Soul was
sure she should die; and Marie Bashkirtseff makes
painstaking note of the size of her hips and the development
of her bust; and poor Amiel bewails the
fate of eating breakfast facing an empty chair; and
Rousseau explains the delicate sensations and smells
that swept over him on opening his wardrobe and
finding smocks and petticoats hanging in careless negligence
amid his man’s clothes; and all those other
pathetic, foolish, charming, irrelevant bits of prattle,
one is convinced of the author’s honesty. No thorough-going
literary man, hot for success, would leave
such stuff in; he would as soon think of using a
flesh brush on the public street; these are his own
private affairs—his good sense would have forbade.</p>

<p>A good lie for its own sake is ever pleasing to honest
men, but a patched up record never. And when
such small men as Samuel Pepys and James Boswell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
can write immortal books, the moral for the rest of
us is that a little honesty is not a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>And so I swing back to the place of beginning and
say that while even a sham confession may be interesting
to hoi polloi, yet to secure an endorsement
from such minds as that of Emerson, George Eliot
and Walt Whitman the confession must be genuine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SOCIAL_SPOTTER">THE SOCIAL SPOTTER.</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Why don’t the young folks marry?” continues,
in the intervals of other jeremiad problems,
to puzzle the good people who call themselves
publicists, having a brevet authority to set everything
right in the world. It is assumed that if the young
people would only marry up to the full proportion,
most of the ills that afflict an over-civilized and
over-sensitized society would cure themselves. The
young people would have something else to do besides
“dabbling in the fount of fictive tears” and inventing
new wants. The old ones would suffice, when
multiplied in kind after the usual fashion.</p>

<p>It is an old story that young men are afraid of
the cost of marriage. The girls are less simple than
their mothers and complexity in matters of taste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
means expense. A clever verse writer has told of
the hardships of a pair who wooed on a bicycle built
for two and afterwards tried to live on a salary built
for one. It is funny in the telling but tragic in the
living. It is a trying business to keep up to concert
pitch in these days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>But is she warranted harmless?</i></div>

<p>The complexity of social expression is not the only
dragon in the way. We have adopted from abroad
something French. It came via England, but France
is its origin. It is the Chaperone. She is usually
harmless personally, but she means a great deal.
She stands for a state of society where marriage is
always a failure. Ask Emile Zola if you don’t
believe it. “Modern Marriage” has the specifications.
We have good women and manly men in
America. The grisette isn’t an institution with us.
Neither is the man who supports her until he is rich
enough to make a French marriage. We have him
and we have her, but neither is universal. The
<i>mariage de convenance</i> and the institution which
precedes it in France are not general with us. The
chaperone is part of the system with them. The
chaperone implies the others. She is a standing notice
that young man and young woman are not to be
trusted together. In some of our cities it is such
very good “good form” to send a guardian with
young people that a woman of over twenty-five has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
been known to cancel an engagement to attend a
company which she had anxiously wanted to enjoy
and for which she had made great preparation,
because a married sister could not accompany her.
She would not go without a chaperone. It was not
“good form.”</p>

<p>O ye gods, Good Form! What was good form,
and who promulgated its laws, when the father and
mother of us all, better than any of us, walked with
the Creator of the universe in the garden in the cool
of the day? But “evil came into the world” and
changed it. Yes, the evil of “good form,” the
embodied self-consciousness which chains all the
virtues and makes the decencies compulsory and
puts on them the brand of the police blotter.</p>

<p>In the name of all that is good why should we
watch the young people? The middle-aged need it
more. Youth is chivalrous. Middle age is commonplace.
It is not youth that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Eats for his stomach and drinks for his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And loves for his pleasure—and ’tis time he was dead.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Chaperon the married victims of the French system.
Put the spotter on the track of the woman
who was taught she couldn’t trust herself when she
was young and the man was complacently branded a
roue when his heart was fresh and warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>It is time for a new declaration of independence, and
the youth of our land should make it. Let Young
America say this: “The woman I cannot honorably
woo, whose care at a social gathering is denied me
without a policeman and a spy, may find another
knight.” Let the maidens of our day, better cultured
than their mothers, broader in their training,
surer of their social footing, stronger in their poise
and presence of mind, bar out the man who comes
into their presence under a ban.</p>

<p>How long would the hollow mockery of “good
form” endure such a strike? As many minutes as it
should take to show its utter falsehood and the cruel
slander it implies. Until the young people so assert
themselves the imitated bars sinister of the most corrupt
social heraldry of Europe will be ours—worn
with an affectation of pride in the dishonor they
blazon. Till then men will be equalized down, not
up; and the talk of “emancipated woman” will be
an insult. When it is done there will be more marriages
of the kind to be desired—the union of true
men and self-respecting women.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">When I first knew her she was a very little girl
in a white dress—starched very stiff—and she
might have reminded me of Molly in the diverting
story of <i>Sir Charles Danvers</i>.</p>

<p>I was devoted to her sister and I remember her
galumphing into the room at a most inopportune
time, and staring for a moment with eyes very wide
open. Then she ran away and I heard her outside
giggling quietly all by herself.</p>

<p>When the big sister went away for the summer I
went out to the house to tell her good-by. The great
trunk stood in the hall waiting for Charlie Miller’s
man. Seated on top of this was the little sister with
two round bottles held close to her eyes. She said
she was playing theater, and that the bottles made a
lovely opera glass.</p>

<p>I asked her what the play was and she said about
a pretty lady who was pursued by lions and dragons
and things. Then there was a man—a big, nice man—who
came with guns and swords and spears and
killed all the dragons and lions and then he married
the pretty lady.</p>

<p>This was her imagination.</p>

<p>Then I went away—I forget where—and was gone
many years. I came back to be best man at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
wedding of my cousin Anthony. I found that the
little sister was to be the maid of honor, and at the
various functions before the wedding I saw much of
her.</p>

<p>After the ceremony we walked down the aisle
together, and as she took my arm her hand trembled.
When we reached the entrance I turned and looked
square into her glorious eyes. They told me many
things that I was glad to know.</p>

<p>Now—after a year—I am trying to live up to the
ideal man she imagined me to be.</p>

<p>And that’s what makes it hard.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> If I had seen it announcing a special feature in the
<i>World</i> or <i>Herald</i> for a coming Sunday, I would not
have been surprised, but to find the following paragraph
in the editorial columns of <i>The Land of Sunshine</i>
fills me with wonder:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Up to date <i>The Land of Sunshine</i> is the only periodical
in the world whose cover is embellished with
drawings by the Almighty.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be interesting to know what the Recording
Angel thinks of Mr. Lummis’s coupling of the
High Court of Heaven and Aubrey Beardsley. Now
if Mr. Lummis could only get his editorials from the
same source——</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> When Shem Rock, Ham Garland and Japhet Bumball
conspired to spring on an unsuspecting world
that three-cornered story entitled <i>The Land of the
Straddle Bug</i>, they bought two whole bushels of
hyphens. In one chapter, by actual count, forty-seven
compound words are used. They have even
hyphenated such words as dod-rot, dodd-mead, slap-jack,
goll-darn, do-tell and gee-whiz. Ham’s own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
pet “yeh” is used in the story sixty-four times,
which does not include four plain “you’s” and three
“ye’s,” where the Only Original Lynx-eyed Proof-reader
nodded.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is published that the <i>Post</i> contemplated a change
in the appearance and make-up of the paper, but
gave up the scheme lest it shock the readers of Mr.
Godkin’s <i>Evening Grandmother</i>. What would shock
the readers more would be the appearance of life
somewhere about the sheet. I would respectfully
call the attention of the editors of the <i>Post</i> to the fate
which befell the Assyrians. It is written in Isaiah
XXXVII—36: Then the angel of the Lord went
forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred
and four score and five thousand; and when
they arose in the morning: behold, they were all
dead corpses.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="smcap">The Philistine’s</span> plea is for the widest liberty to
individual genius. Perhaps no living man has presented
this plea so strongly in his life and work as
William Morris. The poem herein printed is a taste
of this strong man’s quality. It is taken from that
dainty bundle of beautiful things entitled, <i>Love
Lyrics</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> In that very charming article by Mr. Zangwill in
the last <i>Chap Book</i>, mention is made of the utter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
impossibility of stating a truth so that the majority
will remember or recognize it when they see it again—so
shallow is human wit. In <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> for
July I made bold to insert an extract from the Bible.
No credit was given, however, and the matter was
re-paragraphed. And now, behold, a Chicago paper
arises and calls the quotation rot; several other publications
refute the scriptural statements and a weekly
that is very wise in its day and generation refers to
my irreverence in writing in Bible style.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> In the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i> for July a Dr.
Oppenheimer announces the interesting discovery
why children lie. It has been supposed that they lie,
as a general thing, because they want something, but
it appears that it is because they have something, in
the French sense. It isn’t inherent viciousness but
disease. The doctor says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The children usually are suffering from disorders
of mind or body, or both, which radically interfere
with the transmission of conceptions and perceptions
from the internal to the external processes of expression,
so that they really are unable to be more exact
than they seem.</p>

</div>

<p>This seems to explain several things about our
good friends Landon and Townsend—G. A.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The London <i>Athenæum</i> says “Stephen Crane is the
coming Boozy Prophet of America; his lines send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the cold chills streaking up one’s spine, and we are
in error if his genius does not yet sweep all other
literary fads from the board.”</p>

<p>All of which strikes me as a boozier bit of cymbalism
than any of Mr. Crane’s verses.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> On the authority of the New York <i>Sun</i>, afternoon
teas are growing more and more realistic. That
arbiter of etiquette says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The formality of bidding adieu to the hostess at an
afternoon tea is now dispensed with; the omission is
considered with favor and in good taste. No after
calls are made in acknowledgement of a tea.</p>

</div>

<p>The little trifle of ceremony that stood for courtesy
is about all cast aside. The program now is—Greet,
Eat and Git.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I observe that Mr. Andrew Lang is to write some
verses to be read at a dinner of the Omar Club in
London “on some future occasion.” I shall watch
for these with much interest, remembering, meanwhile,
these verses recently read before that remarkable
organization:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>It is noted that Mr. W. Irving Way of Chicago
was present at the last Omar club dinner. He
should give us some notable reminiscences of the
feast.</p>

<p>Speaking of Way, I hear that he has gone into the
publishing business in Chicago. As a critic of the
mechanical construction of books he is supreme, but
I wonder will his publishing be that of literature or
wool from the wild west.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> “You have us down one dollar for dog tax. I’d

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Buffalo, N. Y., has a <i>Young Ladies’ Magazine</i>. It

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Now that Robert Louis Stevenson’s will has been
published in full text as a feature story, perhaps Mr.
So So McClure may desist. The will is almost as
thrilling as a market report. Its publication explains
in part, however, how the cheap magazine movement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
is founded. Next we shall see the weather and a
Congressional debate among the contents of the
cheap-books.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Prizes are offered in Judge Tourgee’s <i>Basin</i> to
preachers, women and “colored writers,” for short
stories. The Judge is bound to keep solid with the

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is matter of record in <i>McClure’s</i> that Edmund
Goose’s poem on Samoa, which it prints, “reached
Robert Louis Stevenson three days before his death.”
There is a horrible suggestion in the little nonpareil
footnote that the poem may have hastened that sad
event. It’s bad enough.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Ham Garland has gone up the coulee to his farm
near La Crosse and is writing another novel. He is
daily in receipt of letters and telegrams from people
in all parts of the country asking him to pull the
coulee up after him.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> In a recent number of the <i>Chip-Munk</i> it is said the
intelligent compositor set it Charles G——d— Roberts;
and the Only Original Lynx-Eyed being on a journey
the whole edition was printed. It was one of those
very aggravating mistakes that will occasionally occur
even in printerys which print things on the finest
paper.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I greet with exceeding joy the name of a new
writer of stories which appeal to me as being above
the plane of universal grayness which we have viewed
for many months, and for this reason I am glad to
see <i>A Very Remarkable Girl</i> in the quarterly issued
by <i>Town Topics</i>. The author of this story is Mr. L.
H. Bickford of Denver, and the editor of <i>Town
Topics</i> says that he has heretofore been unacquainted
with Mr. Bickford’s work. For many years I have
watched the development of this young author, and
if I am not much mistaken he will yet be heard from
in no uncertain way. I do not believe that the public
has any business with the private life of writers,
but it may be said that Mr. Bickford is twenty-six,
and was born in Leadville, Colorado. For a half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
hour’s entertainment, reading aloud in a hammock,
I know of nothing better than <i>A Very Remarkable
Girl</i>. It is suggestive of the signs of the times.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Good form has determined that special attentions
at a time of bereavement are to be recognized by sending
engraved cards. Some people used to send letters
of thanks for sympathy, but of course cards are
more impressive. A coupon scheme has been suggested,
the thanks to be attached to a ticket to the
funeral.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> And furthermore be it known that the marginal
notes opposite articles in <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> are never
supplied by the authors thereof.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A man in Paris sends me the following delicious
bit clipped from the Paris edition of the New York
<i>Herald</i> of April 1:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, March 31.—The <i>Herald’s</i> leading
editorial to-day says that many surprises await us
in heaven.</p>

</div>

<p>I regret not seeing this editorial of March 31. I
imagine, however, that it related to Reginald de
Koven and his surprise—when he gets there—at
finding he cannot write all the choir music.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/deco4.jpg" width="45" height="30" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Meditations in Motley” reveals a new
American essayist, honest and whimsical, with a
good deal of decorative plain speaking. An
occasional carelessness of style is redeemed by
unfailing insight.—<span class="smcap">I. Zangwill</span> in <i>The Pall Mall
Magazine</i> for April, 1895.</p>

<p>A series of well written essays, remarkable on
the whole for observation, refinement of feeling
and literary sense. The book may be taken as a
wholesome protest against the utilitarian efforts
of the Time-Spirit, and as a plea for the rights
and liberties of the imagination. We congratulate
Mr. Harte on the success of his book.—<i>Public
Opinion</i>, London, England.</p>

<p>Mr. Harte is not always so good in the piece as
in the pattern, but he is often a pleasant companion,
and I have met with no volume of essays
from America since Miss Agnes Repplier’s so
good as his “Meditations in Motley.”—<span class="smcap">Richard
Le Gallienne</span>, in the London <i>Review</i>.</p>
